- Little counter application for sales team to track their daily stats 


- planning to add some analytics in the future to be able to display on the sides to track conversion rates and things 
of that nature.

- Auth isnt complete, if database is setup with it it will just check that the users username exists and redirect to the main application page, 
im writing the auth so i dont need an external service so that will be setup this week or something 

- decrement isnt added yet i just put those buttons there
